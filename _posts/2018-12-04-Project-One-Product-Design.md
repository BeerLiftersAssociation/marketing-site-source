## The functional design of project one
### App Ideas
- The team collectively brainstormed, discussed and finalized an app idea for 2018-2019.  
- We want to build a tool for the open-source community.

### Landscape
At a high level, the landscape is strong for connecting developers to projects.
The landscape is weak for the reverse, maintainers actively seeking and connecting to contributors.
- Most of what is out there is advice based, "how to make your project easier", or "list your project here for people to find".
- The market is strong on tools that help developers profile projects, so that they can pick the best one for them.
  - The market is weak on tools that help maintainers improve the attractiveness of their projects, to attract developers.
    - Especially weak on profiling open source contributors, and presenting candidates to maintainers, to enable active recruiting.

### Strategy
- There is already a healthy solution space for connecting contributors to projects.
- We will build for maintainers, to actively seek and engage contributors for their projects.
- Enrich the open source ecosystem, without introducing un-constructive distraction.

### Features
- *Recruit* (1)
  - Maintainer oriented **contributor engagement** tool
  - Maintainers are busy!  Make it powerful and efficient.
- *Apprenticeship* (2)
  - Solve for dormant projects whose maintainers need to **hand off ownership**.  
  - Blend in elements of **mentorship and grooming**, with the ultimate goal of "handing off the reins".
    - We have all encountered really great projects that went dormant, and lose value due to decay.
- *Curb Appeal* (3)
  - **Project attractiveness**/health based on scoring
  - Aimed at increasing project participation
- *Word-on-the-street* (4)
  - Experimental.  Sentiment oriented project metadata analysis
  - Aimed at understanding whether **stakeholder/community satisfaction** is growing.
