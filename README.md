## Getting Started

### Deployment
Need to clone both:
https://github.com/BeerLiftersAssociation/marketing-site-source
https://github.com/BeerLiftersAssociation/beerliftersassociation.github.io

Create and manage changes in the marketing-site-source repo
Use the marketing-site-source/deploy.sh to drop jekyll build output (including functionality supported by plugins), into the Org GH Pages repo.
The script will handle everything.
