## What is going on here?
We "chartered" under the following shared goals.  And because its not official until you have a mission statement.

#### Commitment
- Casual, (1/hr a week)
- Open-source
- Side project

#### Growth
- Cloud software development and site reliability in a devops era.
- Collaborative portfolio that can be showcased in an interview setting.  BOOM TEAMWORK!
- Enrich industry profiles (github presense, technical content publishing).
- See "Code of Conduct" below.

#### Contribute
- Give back to the open source community

## How do you work?
- The Github suite and Slack work well at this scale.
- Chat over email, native workflow tools (issue comment, etc) over direct messaging.

## Is this effort about beer?
- No, we just like it.

## What is up with the lifter thing?
- Like lifting your drink to toast good fortune.
- Or this: <img src="../assets/images/site/beer-lift.png" alt="Test Image" />

## Code of Conduct/Culture
