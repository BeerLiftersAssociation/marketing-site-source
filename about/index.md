### What is going on here?
We share the following interests and goals:
- Light obligation (1/hr a week) open-source side project
- Practice tech skills, focus on cloud software development and site reliability in a devops era.
- Build a collaborative portfolio that can be showcased in an interview setting.
- Improve our industry profiles (github presense, technical writing)
- Promote a knowledge sharing and peer mentorship culture.

### How do you work?
- The Github workflow suite and Slack for coordination work well at this scale.

### Is this effort about beer?
- No - we just like it.
